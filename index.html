				<strong>2024-10-09</strong> Still sorry for my lateness. A new pedal has arrived, which is more than just interesting. Analogman Bueno Boost
				with a probably real NKT-275 inside. Have to work with this one some time. Sounds great so far, but in some way different to my former setup,
				which still is not that bad. See
				<a href="#" onclick="goto('./page/application/equipment/pedals/')">Pedals</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>2024-10-01</strong> Discarded my Pedal PROTEIN from Brown Amplifications. Ah, please don't!
			</li>

				<strong>2024-09-08</strong> I am very sorry for my lateness. Please forgive me. My new guitar mentioned two points below
				is ready for take off now. And I reactivated my Pedal PROTEIN from Brown Amplifications. See
				<a href="#" onclick="goto('./page/application/equipment/pedals/')">Pedals</a>. Somewhat is going to fly right now.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>2024-09-03</strong> Decided to have some remote GIT repository for the code used on this site. See
				<a href="https://github.com/RogerJFX/rogerfrancis" target="_blank">Code on github</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>2024-08-27</strong> A new guitar has arrived, some, I dreamt of in about 1988. It's a Charvel in Telecaster
				style, but with tremolo, shaping and Fishman humbuckers (splittable). The twang is there, really astonishing.
				Should become a veritable Foxy Lady, once I set it up to my needs.
				Maybe it'll be played on my first track, that soon ought to be published here.
				Bought it from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7wHE2AAVcnExMG9GTcLQQ" target="_blank">Ulrich Schadeck</a>. Hugs!

			<li>
				<strong>2024-08-24</strong> Implemented the Takes section. Some very old songs used. Stay tuned.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>2024-08-21</strong> Switched over to some well known color layout. Well known by programmers, agreed,
				called Darcula.	Many hugs to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>2024-08-20</strong> Decided to first tell something about my harness before presenting some results.
				Therefor this site itself had to be improved a bit.
