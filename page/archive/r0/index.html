            <strong>2025-01-15</strong> <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/contact/')">Contact page</a> implemented.
            So you might leave me a message right here from now on. And yes, I went to internationalization.
            Everything is going to become good.

            <strong>2024-11-14</strong> Those Synergy guys are really crazy. Currently learning the art of playing the
            guitar. New GIT-branch. I am not sure, if internationalization is useful here on this page. What is guitar
            in Spanish or French?
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-11-06</strong> Put my new Synergy SYN2 with a Tweet and a Plexi module into normal context.
            Currently, I cannot believe it. Who is crazy? Is it me? Really? Simply incredible, what they did.
            See <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/application/equipment/amps/')">Amps</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-10-26</strong> Added an option to tell more of a take, if needed. See
            <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/takes/')">takes</a> or jump directly to an <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/takes/single/old/?t=bubble')">example</a>.
            Takes will come. My last working day as software engineer is at the end of this month. And yes, I ordered some Synergy stuff just to get rid of
            my Simplifier. The Analogman Bueno Boost is out, by the way. Don't like it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-10-09</strong> Still sorry for my lateness. A new pedal has arrived, which is more than just interesting. Analogman Bueno Boost
            with a probably real NKT-275 inside. Have to work with this one some time. Sounds great so far, but in some way different to my former setup,
            which still is not that bad. See
            <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/application/equipment/pedals/')">Pedals</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-10-01</strong> Discarded my Pedal PROTEIN from Brown Amplifications. Ah, please don't!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-09-08</strong> I am very sorry for my lateness. Please forgive me. My new guitar mentioned two points below
            is ready for take off now. And I reactivated my Pedal PROTEIN from Brown Amplifications. See
            <a href="#" onclick="goto('/page/application/equipment/pedals/')">Pedals</a>. Somewhat is going to fly right now.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-09-03</strong> Decided to have some remote GIT repository for the code used on this site. See
            <a href="https://github.com/RogerJFX/rogerfrancis" target="_blank">Code on github</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-08-27</strong> A new guitar has arrived, some, I dreamt of in about 1988. It's a Charvel in Telecaster
            style, but with tremolo, shaping and Fishman humbuckers (splittable). The twang is there, really astonishing.
            Should become a veritable Foxy Lady, once I set it up to my needs.
            Maybe it'll be played on my first track, that soon ought to be published here.
            Bought it from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7wHE2AAVcnExMG9GTcLQQ" target="_blank">Ulrich Schadeck</a>. Hugs!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-08-24</strong> Implemented the Takes section. Some very old songs used. Stay tuned.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-08-21</strong> Switched over to some well known color layout. Well known by programmers, agreed,
            called Darcula.	Many hugs to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">Jetbrains</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2024-08-20</strong> Decided to first tell something about my harness before presenting some results.
            Therefor this site itself had to be improved a bit.
