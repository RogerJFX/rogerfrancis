    <h3>Brush With The Born</h3>
    <p>
        This is a tribute to Jeff. And to my friend Mr. Born. Well, I thought, it'd be a good idea to do so for my first
        sample recording.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just 3 tracks mixed together roughly. Two guitar tracks and a bass guitar track. Only a bit editing to get it a
        take in the end. Slight usage of compression during the mix.
    </p>
    <p>
        Theme is the old NKT-275 Rangemaster sound, which in my opinion is hard to handle. So I had an Analogman
        BiComp followed by an Analogman Beano Boost inside a Lehle Parallel to only spice up the sound a bit. More,
        behind the Lehle I had to use an Empress ParaEQ to filter out some treble frequencies.

        So I ended up having 3 germanium boost pedals at once in my chain. Too much, if not regulated by an equalizer afterward.

        Anyway, this sound cuts through a mix very well, even if there are tons of other tracks. Only there is no need here,
        thus the cautious handling as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thematic decision was to use the Plexi module of my Synergy, though I don't really like this kind of sound.
        It is such easy to deal with, making it really hard to play something good. In comparison, a Tweed sound is much
        more honest and therefore gives the needed resistance to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        A word to the bass guitar: I am not a bass guitar player. Normally guitarists are awfully bad bass players, so am I.
        We are simply too nervous for that job, too fiddly. We even haven't got a clue, how to accomplish it. Guess,
        bass players are very specific kind of musicians. Anybody out there?
        However, this recording seems ok to me, maybe because it's played on a fretless bass. Some issues are left, but
        better having a track in the mood than something overcorrect. Agreed?
