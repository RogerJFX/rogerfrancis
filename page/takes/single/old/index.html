        Let me tell some tale about this song and others, that were produced that time, round about the year 2000.
    </p>
    <div>
        Setup those times:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Computer with Intel PII 300MHz, Echo Soundcard, Cubase, Waves Plugins
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensoniq DP4+ as the digital amplifier for guitar and bass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proteus 2000 as the sound expander. Still love it, by the way.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ovation Electric Legend acoustic guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some Telecaster, that I built in 1988.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        Just some more words about my Ensoniq DP4+. <strong>DON'T!</strong> You will never get a sound out of this digital crap.
        It only may sound great for some moment, or if you are not really capable to play. All that other crap from
        nowadays is not worth mentioning, even if it is developed further. Buy some good amp, dude!
