			<strong>Hey, my name is Roger.</strong> As You might see, I am a very young man.
			Just forgot to shave me this morning.
			<br /><br />
			I am a guitar player, singer, whatever. I once have started with the violin, though.
			<br /><br />
			My current goal is to introduce some very nice <a onclick="goto('./equipment/guitars')" href="#">guitars</a>. And how they may be played.
			<br /><br />
			If You are in luck, I once will play some lovely lullabies for You.
