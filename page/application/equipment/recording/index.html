                <strong>Focusrite Scarlet 18i20</strong> Runs brilliantly on Linux systems, even better than on Windows,
                since Linus himself should have written the driver. Can be configured like hell using the GUI from Geoffrey
                Bennet. See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui">alsa-scalett-gui</a> on github.com.
                One of those arguments to never use Windows again.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Neumann KH 120 II</strong> Not worth mentioning. After calibrating them (you need a matching mic and the software), they sound fantastic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Headphone amp and plenty of headphones</strong> Nothing to say further here, except there are some headphones of remarkable quality in my box.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cable</strong> Vovox. If I am running out with them - come on, you should know.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <strong>Harrison Mixbus</strong> Runs on Linux and exceptionally on the OS for stupids.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Audacity</strong> Runs on Linux. Often annoying.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cubase</strong> Ok. After all, I have it. And a real new version. Beat me! And, even worse, I can run it on my most beloved OS.
            </li>
