    <p>Just to extract some pedals I will never give away.</p>
    <p>First pedals are used in a row with my zero watt amp for testing at this very moment.</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matallin Germanium Boost</strong> Maybe one of a kind. I once bought it from Miguel from Spain.
                Got a Benson Germanium Boost as well, but still keep preferring Miguel's version.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OKKO V.I.B.</strong> Yes, it's a configurable buffer. Absolutely a MUST, if a guitar player can play his guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Kingley Minstrel V3</strong> Very sophisticated overdrive handling using a tube. Best tube inside,
                I could find. Of course from TAD.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tubesteader Lightkeeper</strong> Again a tube, but this one shapes towards crystal Fender sounds.
                In some way, it is high end, what is coming out. And of course another high-end tube from TAD inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dickmann Engineering SpaceBar</strong> I really don't know what Norbert did by inventing this device.
                Can't live without it anymore.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TC Electronic Chorus Flanger</strong> The classic chorus. Here is an old one with own power supply inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Source Audio Collider</strong> Digital, but ok. Just adds some delay/reverb, which I don't really need.
                Just for some convenience while playing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wren&Cuff Gold Comp</strong> Germanium Compressor/Boost mainly used in front of my Fender Champ.
                In between there commonly is a OKKO V.I.B. as mentioned above.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        No Klon Centaur or clone? No Analogman NKT? <strong>NO!</strong> Tried out a lot of them. May you become happy with that stuff.
        Leave me alone with it.
