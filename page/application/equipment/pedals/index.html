    <p>Just to extract some pedals I will never give away.</p>
    <p>First pedals are used in a row with my zero watt amp for testing at this very moment.</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matallin Germanium Boost</strong> Maybe one of a kind. I once bought it from Miguel from Spain.
                Got a Benson Germanium Boost as well, but still keep preferring Miguel's version.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OKKO V.I.B.</strong> Yes, it's a configurable buffer. Absolutely a MUST, if a guitar player can play his guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Kingsley Minstrel V3</strong> If you haven't got one, you missed something. Brings the tube
                spirit back to any cold setup like solid state amps or maybe even digital crap.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tubesteader Lightkeeper</strong> Again a tube, but this one shapes towards crystal Fender sounds.
                In some way, it is high end, what is coming out. And of course another high-end tube from TAD inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dickmann Engineering SpaceBar</strong> I really don't know what Norbert did by inventing this device.
                Can't live without it anymore.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TC Electronic Chorus Flanger</strong> The classic chorus. Here is an old one with own power supply inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Source Audio Collider</strong> Digital, but ok. Just adds some delay/reverb, which I don't really need.
                Just for some convenience while playing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>MXR Carbon Copy Deluxe</strong> Analog Delay, mono. Grabbed it out my box after some time
                and enjoy it again.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wren&Cuff Gold Comp</strong> Germanium Compressor/Boost mainly used in front of my Fender Champ.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analogman Mini Bicomp</strong> Very special compressor. Typical american. Great, but after all
                too much sugar. Hard to deal with.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analogman Beano Boost</strong> Something like a rangemaster. Great, yes, but not in any way.
                Hard to deal with.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Empress ParaEQ Deluxe</strong> Problem solver. Contains a boost, which is of outstanding quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cornerstone Colloseum</strong> Preferred over some other overdrives. Still not satisfied.
                In the box these days. May be coming back once.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lazy J Cruiser Deuce</strong> Next approach on overdrive pedals. We will c. Gimme some time to
                get done with it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OKKO Cocaine</strong> Very nice optical compressor with boost. Very neutral, so doesn't
                affect the sound as concerning to frequencies. Not in my setup at the moment, but in my mind. Good to
                have a reliable compressor like this one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Others</strong> Man, that's what I call thrill. Just to mention all those overdrive pedals - it's a mess.
                There is a box right about here at my flat with all those pedals, that I sorted out. Some of them went back to usage,
                though. As an example I am a bit in doubt of once activating the Tubescreamer, that I once just bought
                to have one. Others, like the MXR Carbon Copy Deluxe, came back to me. Anyway I don't have devices,
                that I know not matching my favour like a rat or so.
