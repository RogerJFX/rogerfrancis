    <p>Just to extract some pedals I will never give away.</p>
    <p>First pedals are used in a row with my zero watt amp for testing at this very moment.</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Matallin Germanium Boost</strong> Maybe one of a kind. I once bought it from Miguel from Spain.
                Got a Benson Germanium Boost as well, but still keep preferring Miguel's version.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OKKO V.I.B.</strong> Yes, it's a configurable buffer. Absolutely a MUST, if a guitar player can play his guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>JHS Milkman</strong> Just to put some creamy room to the sound. One of my few not always on pedals.
                Beware, if there are some mid boosted in the chain. Great in front of a Tweet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tubesteader Lightkeeper</strong> Again a tube, but this one shapes towards crystal Fender sounds.
                In some way, it is high end, what is coming out. And of course another high-end tube from TAD inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dickmann Engineering SpaceBar</strong> I really don't know what Norbert did by inventing this device.
                Can't live without it anymore.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TC Electronic Chorus Flanger</strong> The classic chorus. Here is an old one with own power supply inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Source Audio Collider</strong> Digital, but ok. Just adds some delay/reverb, which I don't really need.
                Just for some convenience while playing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wren&Cuff Gold Comp</strong> Germanium Compressor/Boost mainly used in front of my Fender Champ.
                In between there commonly is a OKKO V.I.B. as mentioned above.
            </li>
