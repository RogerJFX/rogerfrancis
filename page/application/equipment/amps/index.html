        You won't ask me, will you? Leave me alone playing my old Fender Champ with only one or two pedals ahead (See <a href="#" onclick="goto('../pedals')">Pedals</a>).
        The Champ is reference. Volume to the max, and if I forget to close the window, my female neighbor is going to
        behave strange for a couple of days. No, not because she is annoyed, believe me.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Fender Champ from 1978</strong> Come on, questions? This amp is some kind of reference.
                Got the original tubes, and they still are very fine. Replaced them by some splendid tubes from TAD, though.
                Great decision, as the new tubes sound remarkably better. In some way smoother or more musical, I would say.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bogner Goldfinger SL45 with matching Goldfinger Cab 2x12</strong> To carry the heavy load.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Victory Duchess Deluxe</strong> Only a guess: should become my favorite for heavy purposes at last.
                Currently struggling with my preference for 1x10 cabs. The trebles seem a bit too tasty.
                Hoping to get it done with my Kingley Minstrel as mentioned in section <a href="#" onclick="goto('../pedals/')">Pedals</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Humboldt Simplifier Mk2</strong> Mentioned, since it is a great amp for practicing and figuring
                out which pedals to use. Currently used frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Others</strong> Like a Boogie Mk5 25 and so. Or an Amp One.
            </li>
