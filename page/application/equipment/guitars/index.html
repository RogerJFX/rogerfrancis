    <p>Just a list of my favorite guitars. I am convinced, a guitar only can be good, if it is played regularly.
        Of course, you cannot make a broomstick a good guitar, so the prerequisites should match.
    </p>
    <p>Mind the strings, as they are very, very important. I personally only play Thomastik strings, so
        <strong>Thomastik-Infeld</strong> on the guitars mentioned below. More, if a guitar has no vibrato, I prefer the size .011 to .052, otherwise
        normal .010 to .046.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS Hollowbody II Piezo</strong> Feels like a part of me. Does, whatever I want. Maybe I am a bit too young for this guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS McCarty 594 Joe Walsh</strong> Incredible piece of a guitar. Must be played every day and does not stop becoming better then,
                whereby I never know what exactly became better. The guitar or me? Reminds me of a once very beloved woman.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS 509</strong> Wood library. Swamp ash body and maple neck.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS Custom 24 Piezo</strong> If you are in doubt, take your Custom 24.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Musicman Cutlass SSS</strong> Often preferred over my PRS 509. It's a real cutlass, man. Forget about a Strat.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        So I am a PRS-Player? Ok, talking about the two guitars first listed above: they are simply incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
        My Cutlass is incredible as well, but in another respect. This guitar once convinced me to keep handling with cheap Strat sounds.
