    <p>Just a list of my favorite guitars. I am convinced, a guitar only can be good, if it is played regularly.
        Of course, you cannot make a broomstick a good guitar, so the prerequisites should match.
    </p>
    <p>Mind the strings, as they are very, very important. I personally only play Thomastik strings, so
        <strong>Thomastik-Infeld</strong> on the guitars mentioned below. More, if a guitar has no vibrato, I prefer the size .011 to .052, otherwise
        normal .010 to .046.
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS McCarty 594 Joe Walsh</strong> Incredible piece of a guitar. Must be played every day and does not stop becoming better then,
                whereby I never know what exactly became better. The guitar or me? Reminds me of a once very beloved woman.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS Hollowbody II Piezo</strong> 10 Top. Feels like a part of me. Does, whatever I want.
                Maybe I am a bit too young for this guitar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS Custom 24 Piezo</strong> If you are in doubt, take your Custom 24. Not only a swiss knife, but
                with own special flavour. And a piezo.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Charvel Pro-Mod So-Cal St.2 HH 2PT BKA</strong> Real gem, though affordable. Somewhat in between a Telecaster and a
                hard rock guitar with tremolo, Fishman PUs and so. Bought it from my dear friend
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ7wHE2AAVcnExMG9GTcLQQ" target="_blank">Ulrich Schadeck</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Musicman Cutlass SSS</strong> Often preferred over my PRS 509. It's a real cutlass, man. Forget about a Strat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PRS 509</strong> Wood library. Swamp ash body and maple neck. Best neck, I ever had the chance to touch.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gibson SG, highly modified</strong> Nothing original despite the wood.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ibanez 5-string fretless bass with additional piezo PU</strong> Great shot in any respect.
                Needs a good compressor.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        This listing above is meant as a chart of my favorites. But it changes from now to then. So the sorting is just a snapshot.
