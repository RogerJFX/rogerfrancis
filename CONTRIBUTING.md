Contributing to this project
-

Want to contribute, dude? It would be highly appreciated. Programmers, musicians, translators, humans are welcome.

Programmers usually needn't read this.

### Preconditions

- You should agree with the concept of this project. No framework, no backend, nothing but simple HTML 
enhanced by some JavaScript.
- You should be familiar with GIT. Don't worry, it isn't that hard to learn.
- You should have an account here on github.com.
- You should have a running webserver installed on your computer like nginx or so, no addons required.
- A good IDE like IntelliJ is helpful, so e.g. for all those merge conflicts to expect.

### Some explanation

This project currently is very lively, that means: changes are done very often, comparable to some social media
stuff. This might become some matter of change in the future.

As an example, there currently is some i18-branch. Nobody knows if this approach is alright. It depends on the
translators' business. But there still are none of them.

So if you are a translator, just be careful to not take too much affords yet.

### So far

Sorry, I don't know you. So I yet can make you contributor, but not collaborator. We need to have some
mugs of beer first.

### Procedure

- Signed in your account fork this repo.
- Clone the code to your hard disc and start your lovely work.
- Once You are sure, everything is working properly, create a pull request. We will get around all those merge 
conflicts.
